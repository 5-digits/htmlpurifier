Security and bugfix release 2.1.5 is a backport that fixes two vulnerabilities
related to CSS, one of which only occurs under Shift_JIS. It also improves
imagecrash protection (percent CSS width and height is now disabled for
images, and you can control the bounds with %CSS.MaxImgLength and
%HTML.MaxImgLength). Finally, there are number of bug fixes, most notably 
support for text-decoration: none, improved adherence to Unicode and increased
percent encoding checks.
