Security release 2.1.4 is a backport release that fixes a vulnerability
related to URI handling. In addition, it also includes a number of
bugfixes that have accumulated in the HTML Purifier 3 series but had
not been merged back yet. Please remember that HTML Purifier 2.1 will
be deprecated and will be officially dropped by the end of 2008. Please
only use it for legacy PHP 4 installs.
