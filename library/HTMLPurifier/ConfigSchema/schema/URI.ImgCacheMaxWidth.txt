URI.ImgCacheMaxWidth
TYPE: int/null
DEFAULT: null
VERSION: 3.3.0
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
This directive controls the maximum width in pixels of image tag embedded resources 
found in <img src="">. If the width of an image is larger than this value, the image will 
be resampled and cached into onto your server at the path defined by URI.ImgCachePath.
Note that this is an integer value.
</p>
<p>
Both this and ImgCacheMaxHeight must be set to non-zero values in order for 
ImgCache to do its thing. The cached image is given a new unique file name.
</p>
<p>
Appropriate width and height attributes will automatically be added to the img tag.
Be careful using this with HTML.MaxImgLength. If the value of HTML.MaxImgLength is 
smaller than URI.ImgCacheMaxWidth, the width attribute will be set to HTML.MaxImgLength,
but the image will be resampled using URI.ImgCacheMaxWidth.
